# Designing Customer Data Platform

### What is a Customer Data Platform

A Customer Data Platform (CDP) is a piece of software that combines data from multiple tools to create a single centralized customer database containing data on all touch points and interactions with your product or service. That database can then be segmented in a nearly endless number of ways to create more personalized marketing campaigns.
